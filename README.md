# voice_interpolation - Interpolating between male and female voices

This is the repo used in our source filter modelling approach to voice interpolation. 
In our master's thesis we investigated morphing voices in order to change their perceived gender. 
Our final approach was parametric source filter modelling of the voices, and interpolating in parametrizations of the filters and resampling the frequency of the source.

## Using the repo: 
- Use ps_interpolation_main.m to try out different modelling and interpolation methods
- Use generate_interpolations.m to generate a batch of morphed voices
